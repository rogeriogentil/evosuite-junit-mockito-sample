This is a sample project to simulate the question reported on issue [EvoSuite/evosuite#268](https://github.com/EvoSuite/evosuite/issues/268). 

Apparently, there is a bug on version 1.0.6 that doesn't allow that EvoSuite generated tests are running together human-written tests when the project contains a CDI dependency and uses mocks on the unit tests.
